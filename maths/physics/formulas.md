## 🔹 1. Laws of Motion

- Newton's 1st Law: Object at rest stays at rest until a force excerted on it.
- Newton's 2nd Law: **F = m·a**.
- Newton's 3rd Law: Every action has equal and opposite reaction.

---

## 🔹 2. Equations of Motion

- v = u + at  
- s = ut + ½ at²  
- v² = u² + 2as

---

## 🔹 3. Work, Power, and Energy

- Work = **Force × Displacement**  
- Power = **Work / Time**  
- Kinetic Energy = **½ mv²**  
- Potential Energy = **mgh**

---

## 🔹 4. Laws of Reflection & Refraction

- **Angle of Incidence = Angle of Reflection**  
- Snell’s Law: **n₁ sin θ₁ = n₂ sin θ₂**

---

## 🔹 5. Refractive Index

- n = c / v  
  where c = speed of light in vacuum, v = speed in medium

---

## 🔹 6. Speed of Sound

- v = √(γRT/M) — in gases  
- v = √(T/μ) — in strings

---

## 🔹 7. Types of Motion

- Translatory (straight line)  
- Rotatory (circular)  
- Vibratory (oscillations)

---

## 🔹 8. Waves & Acoustics

- Frequency (f) = 1 / Time period (T)  
- v = f·λ (wave speed)  
- Applications of Ultrasonic: **SONAR, cleaning, imaging**
