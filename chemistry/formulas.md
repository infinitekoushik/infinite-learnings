# 🧪 Applied Chemistry – Diploma Year 1

---

## 🔹 1. States of Matter

- Solid: Definite shape & volume  
- Liquid: Definite volume, no shape  
- Gas: No fixed shape or volume  
- Plasma & Bose-Einstein Condensate (advanced states)

---

## 🔹 2. Atomic Structure

- Electron = Negative  
- Proton = Positive  
- Neutron = Neutral  
- Atomic Number = No. of protons  
- Mass Number = Protons + Neutrons

---

## 🔹 3. Chemical Bonding

- Ionic Bond: Transfer of electrons (metal + non-metal)  
- Covalent Bond: Sharing of electrons (non-metal + non-metal)  
- Hydrogen Bond: Weak bond between molecules

---

## 🔹 4. Water Treatment (for Engineering Chemistry)

- Coagulation → Sedimentation → Filtration → Chlorination  
- Potable water = Safe, odorless, colorless, non-toxic  
- Hardness caused by Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ ions

---

## 🔹 5. Acids, Bases, Salts

- pH Scale: 0–14  
  - Acidic: <7  
  - Neutral: =7  
  - Basic: >7  
- HCl = Strong acid  
- NaOH = Strong base

---

## 🔹 6. Fuels & Calorific Value

- Fuel = Substance that produces heat  
- Calorific Value = Amount of heat produced per unit mass  
- Measured in **kJ/kg**

---

## 🔹 7. Environmental Chemistry (link to Environment folder)

- Greenhouse gases: CO₂, CH₄, N₂O  
- Acid Rain = Caused by SO₂ + NOx  
- Ozone Layer = Absorbs UV radiation

🧠 *I study chemistry not just for exams but to understand how matter behaves, interacts and fuels the world around us.*
