# ðŸ”¬ Quantum Foundations â€“ Koushik's Notes

This folder contains the key principles of quantum physics, time, energy, 11 dimensions, dark energy, consciousness and many more in future ~ the subjects I'm mastering to understand reality itself.

## ðŸ”¹ 1. What is Quantum Physics?

- Study of matter and energy at subatomic scales  
- Reality behaves unpredictably at quantum levels  
- Particles can exist in **multiple states** (superposition)

---

## ðŸ”¹ 2. Time Dilation

- Time slows down as velocity increases (Einstein's relativity)  
- Formula:  
  t = tâ‚€ / âˆš(1 âˆ’ vÂ²/cÂ²)  
  where:
  - t = time observed  
  - v = velocity  
  - c = speed of light

## ðŸ”¹ 3. Quantum Entanglement

- When two particles become linked â€” changing one instantly changes the other, even across space  
- Einstein called it *"spooky action at a distance"*

---

## ðŸ”¹ 4. 11 Dimensions (String Theory)

1. 3 Spatial (length, width, height)  
2. 1 Time  
3. 6 Curled dimensions  
4. 1 Membrane (universe boundary)

- These extra dimensions may explain gravity, consciousness, and parallel worlds

---

## ðŸ”¹ 5. Dark Energy & Dark Matter

- Dark Matter = Invisible matter that has mass but no light  
- Dark Energy = Force accelerating universe expansion

---

## ðŸ”¹ 6. Quantum Consciousness

- Brain may function partially like a quantum system  
- Theories suggest consciousness = field interacting with matter  
- May help explain intuition, time loops, deep awareness

ðŸ§  *This is not just science. this is me learning how reality functions at the root level. To understand time, space, and the source of awareness.*
